# Modelling_tools
This repository provides some miscellaneous tools for use with forward modelling software such as Theriak-Domino. PCA, T1, T2, and T3 can be used for any forward modelling program as the required code inputs are CSV files.

## PCA_phase_composition
This code allows the user to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering on any data of interest.

## T1 plotter
This code allows the user to plot the outputs of THERIAK-DOMINO or any other forward modelling software. There are options for contour maps, heatmaps, field stability boundaries, variance, etc.

## T2 correlation
This code allows the user to calculate the correlation coefficient between each variable, temperature and pressure.

## T3  composition calculator
This code allows the user to create a composition file (THERIN.txt) for TD from original weight percent oxide bulk compositions.


## Theriak Domino tools
These packages provide useful tools for modelling and plotting petrological data. Scripts TD1 and TD2 are specific to the program THERIAK-DOMINO. 

<details>
<summary> TD1 loop THERIAK </summary>
This code allows the user to run THERIAK in a loop and save the results to a CSV file.

<summary> TD2 collate DOMINO </summary>
This code allows the user to collate the outputs of DOMINO (a folder containing many text files) into a CSV file containing all the information in P-T order.
